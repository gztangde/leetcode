# Leetcode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** [3,4,5,1,2] 
**Output:** 1

**Example 2:**

**Input:** [4,5,6,7,0,1,2]
**Output:** 0

**Difficulty**:Medium
