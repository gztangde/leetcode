# Question

Given a string S and a string T, find the minimum window in S which will contain all the characters in T in complexity O(n).

**Example:**

**Input: S** = "ADOBECODEBANC", **T** = "ABC"
**Output:** "BANC"

**Note:**

- If there is no such window in S that covers all characters in T, return the empty string  `""`.
- If there is such window, you are guaranteed that there will always be only one unique minimum window in S.

**Difficulty**:Medium
