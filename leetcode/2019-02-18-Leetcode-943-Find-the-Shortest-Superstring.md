# Question

Given an array A of strings, find any smallest string that contains each string in  `A`  as a substring.

We may assume that no string in  `A`  is substring of another string in  `A`.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** ["alex","loves","leetcode"]
**Output:** "alexlovesleetcode"
**Explanation:** All permutations of "alex","loves","leetcode" would also be accepted.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** ["catg","ctaagt","gcta","ttca","atgcatc"]
**Output:** "gctaagttcatgcatc"

**Note:**

1. `1 <= A.length <= 12`
2. `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`

**Difficulty**:Hard
