- [ ] Variable Types: Char, boolean, int, float, long, double
- [ ] String: Tokenization, reverse, get char, manipulate as array of chars
- [ ] Arrays: 1D, 2D, 3D
- [ ] Objects: class/struct, attributes and methods.
- [ ] Sorting: Numbers and strings, Pairs, Custom objects.
- [ ] Assignment: By copy or reference, C++ pointers.
- [ ] Memory: Alloc and dealloc
- [ ] Data Structures and standard Libray: Usage of array/Vector, linked list, (Tree)set, (tree)map, hash-table.

# Fundamental Data Structures:

Array, Linked List, Stack, Queue

For every problem:

* Always read the constraints and determine the extremums for input variables, and the answer.
* Determine what variable you need to use.
  * If you answer will exceed $2*10^9 (32-bit limit), but not 9*10^18$ (64-bit limit), then you mat use 64-bit.
