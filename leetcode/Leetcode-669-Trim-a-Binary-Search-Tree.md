# Question

Given a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as  `L`  and  `R`, trim the tree so that all its elements lies in  `[L, R]`  (R >= L). You might need to change the root of the tree, so the result should return the new root of the trimmed binary search tree.

**Example 1:**  

```
**Input:** 
    1
   / \
  0   2

  L = 1
  R = 2

**Output:** 
    1
      \
       2
```

**Example 2:**  

```

**Input:** 
    3
   / \
  0   4
   \
    2
   /
  1

  L = 1
  R = 3

**Output:** 
      3
     / 
   2   
  /
 1
```
