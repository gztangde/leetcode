# Question

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

**Example 1:**  

**Input:**

```
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7

```

**Output:** [3, 14.5, 11]
**Explanation:**
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].

**Note:**  

1. The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

**Difficulty**:Medium
