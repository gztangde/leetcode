# Question

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

1. 1
2. 11
3. 21
4. 1211
5. 111221

`1`  is read off as  `"one 1"`  or  `11`.  
`11`  is read off as  `"two 1s"`  or  `21`.  
`21`  is read off as  `"one 2`, then  `one 1"`  or  `1211`.  

Given an integer  _n_, generate the  _n_th  term of the count-and-say sequence.

Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.

 **Example 1:**
> **Input:** 1
> **Output:** "1"

**Example 2:**
> **Input:** 4
> **Output:** "1211"
